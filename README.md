Project Overview: Basic Calculator
Objective:
The purpose of this project is to create a simple Python program that functions as a basic calculator. The program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers provided by the user.

Key Features:
User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
The user is then asked to select an arithmetic operation to perform on these numbers.
Operation Options:

The user can choose from four basic operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Calculation and Output:

Based on the userâ€™s choice, the program performs the selected operation.
The result of the operation is displayed to the user.
The program includes error handling for division by zero, ensuring the program does not crash and provides a meaningful error message.
Core Components:
User Input:

The program uses input() to receive two numerical values from the user.
The numbers are converted to float to handle both integers and decimal numbers.
Operation Selection:

The program presents the user with a menu of four operations.
The user selects an operation by entering a corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
Arithmetic Calculations:

The program uses conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine which operation the user selected.
It then performs the appropriate arithmetic operation.
Error Handling:

If the user selects division and the second number is zero, the program detects this and displays an error message to prevent division by zero.
If the user enters an invalid operation (anything other than 1, 2, 3, or 4), the program notifies the user of the invalid selection.
Result Display:

The program prints the result of the operation in a readable format, showing the two input numbers and the result.
Example Workflow:
The user runs the program and is welcomed by a greeting message.
The user is prompted to enter two numbers.
The user selects the operation they want to perform (e.g., addition).
The program performs the calculation and displays the result.
If division is selected and the second number is zero, an error message is shown.
If an invalid operation is selected, the program prompts the user to try again.
Applications:
This basic calculator can be used for simple arithmetic tasks.
It serves as an introductory project for learning basic programming concepts, such as user input, conditional logic, and error handling.
The program can be extended to include more complex operations or a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved user interaction.
Conclusion:
The Basic Calculator project is a simple yet practical Python program that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts. It allows users to perform essential arithmetic operations, handles errors gracefully, and provides immediate feedback, making it a useful tool for both learning and everyday calculations.
